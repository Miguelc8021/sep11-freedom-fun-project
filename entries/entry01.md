This year we were given the oportunity to take everything we have learned in our time in SEP to make a STEM related site to benefit society.  Of course, this would not take a short amount of time, we are given the whole school year to think of ideas of what we would like to do and better our skills in certain types of software programs.  Everything most people decide to make is usually to make our lives easier in a positive way, so therefore I would like to make a type of site that would simplify science related courses to students who don't understand the subject that well.  I believe that this is a great idea because it would heavily benefit students who stuggle with the subject.  I may not be able to make them a top student, which isn't really the purpose, but I would at least give the student a better understanding of a topic than a textbook would.
